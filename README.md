Dynamic Taxi Sharing Problem
1. The TaxiShare.zip contains a Eclipse Java Project.

2. If Eclipse is present it can be directly imported as a project

3. Otherwise, copy the files from the src folder to the project location.

4. Two test cases can be run:

a. Test Network with Arcs â€“ We have created a test network with 30

nodes. This test case uses the Floyd Warshall algorithm to

preprocess. This can be checked by running the Main.java

b. Test Network with 1000 Nodes and 50 Taxis. Here we create

random distance and time values between the nodes without

running the Floyd Warshall Algorithm. This is so because it is very

difficult to create a realistic network on such a large scale and we

could not find any such data online. This test case can be run using

the Test.Java.
